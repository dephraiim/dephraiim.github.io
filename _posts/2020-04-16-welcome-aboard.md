Recently, I came across static sites with Vuepress, Hugo, Jekyll and GatsbyJs.
I have been wanting to this for a while now but doing it the dynamic way would be difficult so I decided to learn Jekyll which is easy and has a ton of resources out there. It is a very good static site hosting and it comes embedded into Github. I am learning React and I will learn GatsbyJs very soon. Once again, Welcome.

FÃ¡ilte ar bord. ðŸ˜‰
